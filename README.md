# BPN Discovery

The BPN Discovery is a logical and architectural component of Tractus-X. The source code under this folder contains reference implementations of the SLDT BPN
Discovery.
The BPN Discovery is used to lookup for a specific type/key-combination to a Business Partner Number (BPN). For example looking for a
combination "oen / oen-133" will lead to "BPNLXYZ123". For a further information have a look in our
[documentation](docs/1-introduction-and-goals.md).

## Build Packages

Run `mvn clean install` to run unit tests, build and install the package.

## Run Package Locally

To check whether the build was successful, you can start the resulting JAR file from the build process by
running `java -jar backend/target/bpn-discovery-backend-{current-version}.jar --spring.profiles.active=local`.

## Build Docker

Run `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t sldt-bpn-discovery .`

In case you want to publish your image into a remote container registry, apply the tag accordingly and `docker push` the image.

## Install Instructions
