# Contributing to Eclipse Tractus-X

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The companies involved want to increase the automotive industry's competitiveness, improve efficiency through industry-specific cooperation and accelerate
company processes through standardization and access to information and data. A special focus is also on SMEs, whose active participation is of central
importance for the network's success. That is why Catena-X has been conceived from the outset as an open network with solutions ready for SMEs, where these
companies will be able to participate quickly and with little IT infrastructure investment. Tractus-X is meant to be the PoC project of the Catena-X alliance
focusing on parts traceability.

## Keeping dependencies-files up to date

Navigate to the `./backend` folder and run:

```shell
mvn org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check
```

This line runs the maven license tool with the parameters specified in the `./backend/pom.xml` and produces a `DEPENDENCIES` file in the root folder of this project.

Further a [workflow](./.github/workflows/dash-dependency-check.yml) is run when merging main to check if everything is up to date.

As a committer, to request IP checks, use this command

```shell
mvn org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check -Ddash.iplab.token=<token>
```
