## 5 Deployment-view

For Deployment needed:

-   Webserver

-   Kubernetes-Cluster

-   Helm

To deploy this system, you need to use the Helm Chart in a running
Kubernetes cluster. The Helm Chart is located under "charts/bpndiscovery".
In case you don't have a running cluster, you can set up one by yourself
locally, using minikube. For more information checkout our readme.md.
